## Security Considerations

- **Encrypted Communication:** All connection information is securely encrypted, safeguarding your credentials and ensuring that your data remains protected at all times.
- **Database Security:** We believe database security should be managed on the database itself, reinforcing access controls and preventing unauthorized access.
