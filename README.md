## Security Considerations

- **Privacy by Design:** Only database schemas are sent to the AI for processing‚Äîno actual table data is transmitted, ensuring the confidentiality of your information.
- **Principled Approach:** We believe that offering database clients as a service poses significant security risks; therefore, ThinkDB is designed to operate securely on your own infrastructure.
- **Encrypted Communication:** All connection information is securely encrypted, safeguarding your credentials and ensuring that your data remains protected at all times.
- **Database Security:** We believe database security should be managed on the database itself, reinforcing access controls and preventing unauthorized access.
- **Custom AI Provider:** Select the AI provider that best suits your needs or host your own AI system, giving you complete control over the AI integration and ensuring it complies with your security policies.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha Version Warning

## Getting Started

### Using Docker (The Simplest Method)

To get ThinkDB up and running quickly using DockerHub:

### Running the Application

1. Pull the latest Docker image:

    ```sh
    docker pull thinkthinkai/think_db:latest
    ```

2. Run the container while ensuring SQLite database persistence and setting the `SECRET_KEY_BASE` environment variable. Remember to replace `directory_on_your_machine_for_think_db_storage` and `your_secret_key_base_here` with your actual directory path and secret key base:

    ```sh
    # change directory_on_your_machine_for_think_db_storage & your_secret_key_base_here
    docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v directory_on_your_machine_for_think_db_storage:/app/storage -e SECRET_KEY_BASE=your_secret_key_base_here thinkthinkai/think_db:latest
    ```
    
### Security Note

It's outside the scope of this README to walk you through securing your Docker container and any web application you host within it. However, we strongly recommend that:

1. **SECRET_KEY_BASE**: This should be managed securely‚Äîpreferably through Docker secrets if using Docker Swarm or Kubernetes, or via a trusted secret management solution‚Äîto ensure it‚Äôs not exposed in plaintext within your environment variables.
2. **TLS/SSL**: Always serve your web application over HTTPS using a valid TLS certificate to encrypt data transmitted over the network.


### Using Rails Outside a Container (The Harder Method)

To run ThinkDB locally using Rails:

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- Ruby (version 3.2.2 or higher)
- Rails (version 7.1 or higher)
- Bundler
- Redis (for Action Cable / Sidekick)

### Steps to Run ThinkDB Outside a Container

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ThinkThinkAI/ThinkDB.git
    cd ThinkDB
    ```

2. Install the necessary gems:

    ```bash
    bundle install
    ```

3. Set up the database:

    ```bash
    bin/rails db:setup
    ```

4. Start the application with the `SECRET_KEY_BASE` environment variable set:

    ```bash
    SECRET_KEY_BASE=$(bundle exec rake secret) foreman start
    ```

## Configuration

ThinkDB is highly configurable to suit your needs. Below are the steps to configure it properly:
