## Security Considerations

- **Privacy by Design:** Only database schemas are sent to the AI for processingâ€”no actual table data is transmitted, ensuring the confidentiality of your information.
- **Principled Approach:** We believe that offering database clients as a service poses significant security risks; therefore, ThinkDB is designed to operate securely on your own infrastructure.
- **Encrypted Communication:** All connection information is securely encrypted, safeguarding your credentials and ensuring that your data remains protected at all times.
- **Database Security:** We believe database security should be managed on the database itself, reinforcing access controls and preventing unauthorized access.

## Getting Started

### Using Docker (The Simplest Method)

To get ThinkDB up and running quickly using DockerHub:

### Running the Application

1. Pull the latest Docker image:

    ```sh
    docker pull thinkthinkai/think_db:latest
    ```

2. Run the container while ensuring SQLite database persistence and setting the `SECRET_KEY_BASE` environment variable. Remember to replace `directory_on_your_machine_for_think_db_storage` and `your_secret_key_base_here` with your actual directory path and secret key base:

    ```sh
    # change directory_on_your_machine_for_think_db_storage & your_secret_key_base_here
    docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v directory_on_your_machine_for_think_db_storage:/app/storage -e SECRET_KEY_BASE=your_secret_key_base_here thinkthinkai/think_db:latest
    ```

### Using Rails Outside a Container (The Harder Method)

To run ThinkDB locally using Rails:

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- Ruby (version 3.2.2 or higher)
- Rails (version 7.1 or higher)
- Bundler
- Redis (for Action Cable / Sidekick)

### Steps to Run ThinkDB Outside a Container

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ThinkThinkAI/ThinkDB.git
    cd ThinkDB
    ```

2. Install the necessary gems:

    ```bash
    bundle install
    ```

3. Set up the database:

    ```bash
    bin/rails db:setup
    ```

4. Start the application with the `SECRET_KEY_BASE` environment variable set:

    ```bash
    SECRET_KEY_BASE=$(bundle exec rake secret) foreman start
    ```
